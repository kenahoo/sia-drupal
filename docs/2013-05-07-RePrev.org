* 7:20 Introduce Margot Willet, leader for tonight

Schele & Dana are unavailable, Margot's filling in.

* 7:25 Team reports

** Jan - Artistic

Thanked section leaders, concert coordinators, and Bill.

** Mike - Financial

Spent around $16K on this concert.  Brought in around $17K between
tickets, sponsors, donations, guest fees for Josh's time, the Rimon
grant, and CD sales.  This concert was sold out on Sunday, pretty good
on Thursday.

Dan's family made a donation in honor of his dad, who died before the
concert but would have loved it.

** Angela - Marketing

Absent.

** Dan - Leadership

Highlighted connections that were made in this concert.  Cantors,
members of TCJC, Rimon, etc. were particularly strong connections we
made.  

** Ken - Tech

Ticket sales were the majority of my time.  We also focused more on
the preview recordings than the weekly rehearsal recordings - the
singers would like to not give up the rehearsal recording regime too.

** Becky - Thanked the leadership team

The choir is planning some kind of night of thanks for the board.

* 7:40 Feedback on the concert

** General

*Margot*: loved it.  Powerful.

*Monica*: loved having Judy Sagen as rehearsalist, thought she would
make a good primary conductor for us too.

*Gloria*: seconded.  Prepared us very well.

*Brandy*: Josh did a great job with the school kids, despite saying he
didn't have much experience with younger-age people.  Collaboration
went great.  He was always very responsive to Brandy's
questions/thoughts in advance.

*Shelby*: loved how the concert was so well-targeted - at the JCC,
found a good audience.

*Kathie*: did a great job running rehearsals and getting results
quickly, vocally & musically.

*Phil*: had great experience.  Thought Judy had a tough time "ramping
up" before she met Josh for the first time.

*Bill*: loved it enough to want to go out to Boston to see a concert.
Acknowledged that Josh was hard on him the first night, but welcomed
it as feedback.

*Kim*: liked Josh a lot.  Wasn't as impressed with Judy, thought she
didn't provide enough leadership for us.

*Rosalie*: really appreciated the warm-ups, helped her voice perform
well.

*Sheri*: thought this was a point in favor of keeping religious music
as "fine" (not capturing this thought very well).

*Etta*: but context is important - felt uncomfortable several times
with Christian assumptions in previous concerts.

*Jan L*: we need to cut rehearsalist some slack.  Also, we had so much
better attendance this time, which was great.

*Ken*: [responding to religious issue] what's uncomfortable for many
people in previous concerts is the assumption that everyone is
Christian, either in the audience or the choir.  Seems very
inappropriate.

*Gloria*: the programming aspect worked really well.

*Shelby*: was really great to have high-caliber instrumentalists, it
brought the singers up to a better level.

*Wendy*: the targeted direct outreach was very successful and we should
try to repeat it.  We need to choose less 'potpourri' programs so we
can target our audiences well.

*Kathie*: was Bill's bio in the program? (yes)

*Bill*: loved playing with the "Varsity" crowd of instrumentalists.

*Rosalie*: how did we get our instrumentalists?

*Dan*: we did a lot of asking around for instrumentalists, got lots of
recommendations, some names came up over & over, those were the
people we persued.


** 8:00 - Venue

Really liked having the same venue twice.

*Judy*: it was a tough hall to work with, the sounds wasn't great and
the lighting was hard for both singers & audience.

*Gloria*: JCC is not an explicitly Jewish place (it's like a Jewish-run
YMCA), which helps contribute to getting more visibility for the show.

*Bill*: recommends that we really try hard to have non-religious venues.

*Margot*: more about having the same venue twice?

*ACTION ITEM*: follow up on seeing where audience's zip codes are.

*Shelby*: it was exhausting having so much in one week.  Would have
been too much to have two venues.

*Monica*: it's good to have one concert in the daylight hours,
especially with older people.

*Shelby*: would also be nice to put concerts in university settings to
attract younger audiences too.

*Joe*: the stage wasn't really big enough to accommodate everyone - the
bassist was basically off stage.  Need to make sure we have big
enough stages.

** 8:15 Growth

*Margot*: how did you (individually & collectively) grow from this
concert?

*Jeremy*: the "moment of zen" was great.

*Joe*: it was surprising when Josh took things so much faster than we
expected.  We basically took care of improving things enough from
Monday to Tuesday when Monday didn't go so well, too.

*Bill*: got off to a bad start on Monday, had a rough start with Josh,
but "turned his attitude around" and ended up loving the
collaboration.

** 8:20 Key things that worked

*Margot*: what were the key things that worked this time around?

*Phil*: Josh really brought the concert alive.

*Stephanie*: good that we got "whipped into shape".

*Ken*: Judy S. deserves a lot of credit for this.

*Etta*: was really important to focus immediately on the language, we
got the Hebrew much better that way.

*Shelby*: true - that was the opposite of last time.

*Judy*: we as singers are really getting better too.

*Shelby*: the blending that Judy did was really good.

** 8:25 Things that didn't work

*Kathie*: was tough to work too much on isolated spots without getting
the context of a piece.

*Gloria*: doesn't really mind that, thinks we should give conductors
the leeway to run things the way they want to.

*Bill*: Judy 

*Dan*: what did people think of bringing someone in for the last week
only?

*Shelby*: thought it was really great.  Probably also helped get the
word out to more people when he was visiting people all week.

*Rachel*: could be pretty risky to bring in someone "famous" that we
don't really know well, it was good to know Josh a bit beforehand.

*Joe*: it could also be really good to bring in big "national people" as
a draw for concerts.

* 8:35 Feedback on the 2012-2013 season

*Sheri*: we got a request from Sandy Browning to send out a letter
laying out our season, at the beginning of the season.

*Joe*: really appreciated having so much variety between the 3 concerts

* 8:40 Business stuff

*Dan*: please keep the SIA email list for only SIA business matters.

*Dan*: feedback on having RePrev the first week vs. the second week
after a concert?

*Monica*: likes to have it right after the concert.  Lose too much focus
by waiting another week.  [Most people agree.]

* 8:42 Next season

*Jan*: first concert is with Matthew Mehaffey [Dan hands out preview
document], Nov. 16 & 17.  Baroque.  At Hamline United Methodist.  Jan
mentioned Michael McGehey for another possibility.

*Dan*: gives a preview of the Mehaffey concert, including playing
Handel's "My Heart is Inditing".

*Joel*: how about modern dance with this?

*Dan*: remember, put the word out to the singers you know, we have
auditions coming up.  Very important to replenish our ranks!  New
singers bring us vitality!

*Mike Mc*: is it possible to keep a selection of repertoire that come
from each concert in our back pocket?

* The End.
