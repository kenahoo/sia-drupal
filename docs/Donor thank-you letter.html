	<p>Dear [% Display_Name %],</p>

	<p>Singers in Accord thanks you for your generous support of the work
	  we do:</p>

	<blockquote>[% Donations %]</blockquote>

	<p>As you know, we are a low budget arts organization, based on a
	  foundation of volunteerism, that values&nbsp;<strong>every
	    dollar</strong> and <strong>every minute</strong> donated to our
	  cause. It's our solid base of family and friends that continue to help
	  our organization grow.</p>

	<p>Your dollars were well spent this year! We continue to enjoy
	  collaborations with new directors for every concert series. Our Fall
	  concert, featuring a return appearance from Dr. David Mennicke, was a
	  challenging and well executed performance of choral classics. Our
	  February 9 &amp; 10 concert with Dr. Peter Hendrickson featured
	  classical and folk music from Central and South America (can you say
	  rhumba?), and our Spring finale, May 2 &amp; 5 with Joshua Jacobson,
	  is a musical dialogue among many styles of Jewish music. An interesting
	  collection of music for our interesting collection of supporters!</p>
	
	<p>We also remind you that we have an ongoing fundraising opportunity
	  through TurnStyle consignment store in Richfield, MN. TurnStyle
	  accepts clothing, accessories, jewelry, household, small furniture,
	  and artwork for resale. Any items you donate towards the Singers in
	  Accord account are tax deductible. You can drop off the items yourself
	  or contact
	  <a href="mailto:sheri.williams@singersinaccord.org">sheri.williams@singersinaccord.org</a>
	  for delivery of goods. Clean out your closet for a good cause!</p>

	<p>Happy New Year to All!</p>
