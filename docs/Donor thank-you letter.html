	<p>Dear [% Display_Name %],</p>

	<p>Since its founding four years ago, Singers in Accord (SIA) choral
	  ensemble has matured into a community of singers whose love for choral
	  music and strong value of partnership and collaboration with other
	  nonprofits has made it a significant Twin Cities community asset.
	  We've been able to do this because of support from donors and friends
	  like you and for this we say Thank you!</p>

	<p>As you may know, SIA is uniquely organized as a singer-led choral
	  ensemble with an all-volunteer singer and leadership organizational
	  structure. It employs no paid staff members, and all money raised goes
	  to creating, marketing and performing our annual concerts. It costs a
	  minimum of about $10,000 to prepare and produce each concert. With our
	  volunteer organizational structure, we have intentionally placed most
	  of our energies and time into developing the musical and operational
	  sides of the organization, using word of mouth and limited marketing
	  to spread the word and recruit financial and volunteer support for our
	  long term sustainability.</p>

	<p>It is time to more decisively broaden our sources and methods of
	  securing financial support and as such have embarked on a drive to
	  establish an Accord Concert Fund. Since we begin planning our concert
	  schedules 18-24 months out, the Accord Concert Fund will give us a
	  financial base to operate from and help us leverage funding from new
	  grants and businesses, many of which require matching dollars for
	  support provided.</p>

	<p>Please consider a generous contribution to the Accord Concert Fund and
	  help us build the sustainability needed to ensure a strong future for
	  SIA. Just <a href="http://www.singersinaccord.org/donate">Click
	  Here</a> to make a 100% tax deductible donation or an annual pledge to
	  the Accord Concert Fund. For every $100 you contribute, we will give
	  you two tickets to our upcoming concert on November 16th and 17th called
	  "Fit for a King: Handel's Coronation Anthems".</p>

	<p>On behalf of the entire ensemble I thank you for helping us to launch
	  our fifth Season and the Accord Concert Fund.</p>

	<p>Gratefully,</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dan Digre, Chairman of the Board</p>
