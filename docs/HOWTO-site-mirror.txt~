How to create a full local mirror of the SIA web site, for testing purposes etc.

1) copy all the files from the live site to the local machine:
  rsync -aKv --exclude=rec --exclude=reh singersinaccord.org:singersinaccord.org/ singersinaccord.org/

I already had the rec/ and reh/ directories locally, and I didn't want to re-copy them because they're big.

2) Make sure MySQL and PHP are installed & working nicely together.  I had to create a symlink for PHP to be happy:
  sudo ln -s /tmp/mysql.sock /var/mysql/mysql.sock

3) Grab the latest live database data and import into MySQL:
  ssh singersinaccord.org cat data/backups/mysql/2012-02-20 | gunzip -c | mysql

4) Create the proper MySQL users:
  GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES ON singersinaccord_drupal.* TO 'sia_drupal'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'ektaa!';
  GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES ON singersinaccord_crm.* TO 'sia_drupal'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'ektaa!';

5) Edit /etc/apache2/httpd.conf to point DocumentRoot to the new singersinaccord.org/ directory:
  DocumentRoot "/Users/ken/Documents/SIA/singersinaccord.org"

6) Enable mod_rewrite in /etc/apache2/httpd.conf:
  AllowOverride All AuthConfig
