Candide, and Gilkyson's touching "Requiem," written after the 2004 Asian
Tsunami.  The group will also perform an arrangement of "I've Got Rhythm,"
by guest director Jerry Rubino, who is a Twin Cities based choral director,
educator and musician. The ensemble is thrilled to collaborate with Rubino
for their inaugural concert series.  Jerry's passion for expressive singing
and dedication to the philosophy that successful artistic performance is

About Singers in Accord:  

Singers in Accord is uniquely structured as a singer-led organization,
dedicated to exploring our humanity through performances of culturally
diverse choral music.  The 34-voice chorale collaborates with a new
conductor, performing artist or artistic ensemble in each concert, to create
distinctive concert experiences for its singers and audience members.
Singers in Accord strives to enrich the cultural life of Minnesota
communities through outreach, education and innovative performances. It is
an auditioned chorale, largely made up of singers from the former World
Voices ensemble which celebrated its 13th and final concert season in the
spring of 2009.  It is a 501(C)(3) non-profit corporation that does not
employ any paid staff.  Because of this, all financial support given is
fully tax deductible and goes directly to supporting its artistic mission
and community outreach efforts.  To that end, their goal is to make concerts
free where possible or extremely affordable, so anyone who desires to
experience a high quality musical performance has the opportunity to do so
without an economic barrier.  For more information on Singers in Accord and
their 2009-10 concert season,  please visit:  www.singersinaccord.org

practice based educational outreach.

conducting and teaching credits include honors choirs in Australia, Taiwan,
Hawaii, and Europe, the Los Angeles Master Chorale, the California State
Summer Arts Workshops, the Wesley Balk Institute for the Singer/Actor
process, and the University of Minnesota Jazz Festival.

in Northfield, Minnesota in 1999, 2003 and 2004.  He was named an editor for
the Voices of Distinction series with Hal Leonard in 2005 and edited a new

Directors Association, is a member of ASCAP and is requested nationally as a
choral clinician, music director, pianist and adjudicator.  For more
